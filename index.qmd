## About me

***'Ia Orana!***

My name is **Keanu Rochette-Yu Tsuen** and I come from the island of **Tahiti, French Polynesia**.

I am a graduate student at the *University of Hawai'i*, pursuing my **MS in Biological Oceanography** with [Dr. Craig Nelson](https://sites.google.com/view/nelsonlab/home).

I am currently working on the effects of benthic species community composition on the **biogeochemistry of coral reefs** in Moorea, French Polynesia. Additionally, I am leading the first **synoptic study** of biogeochemical parameters in the **district of Tautira**, Tahiti.

I am interested in **marine microbiology**, **biogeochemistry** and **sustainable resource management**. I aim to use my scientific experience as a way to connect and collaborate with **local communities** to develop **sustainable management plans** for marine resources.

As a local **Tahitian**, it is a privilege to do research in the place I call home.
