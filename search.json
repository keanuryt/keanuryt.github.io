    "text": "About me\n‚ÄôIa Orana!\nMy name is Keanu Rochette-Yu Tsuen and I come from the island of Tahiti, French Polynesia.\nI am a graduate student at the University of Hawai‚Äôi, pursuing my MS in Biological Oceanography with Dr.¬†Craig Nelson.\nI am currently working on the effects of benthic species community composition on the biogeochemistry of coral reefs in Moorea, French Polynesia. Additionally, I am leading the first synoptic study of biogeochemical parameters in the district of Tautira, Tahiti.\nI am interest in marine microbiology, biogeochemistry and sustainable resource management. I aim to use my scientific experience as a way to connect and collaborate with local communities to develop sustainable management plans for marine resources.\nAs a local Tahitian, it is a privilege to do research in the place I call home."
